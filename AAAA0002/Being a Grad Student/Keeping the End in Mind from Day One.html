        Keeping the End in Mind from Day One

      <p>
        Even though the end-of-program requirement arrives
        only at the conclusion of your studies, keep it at
        the forefront of your mind as you progress through
        your courses. Planning for this final step shouldn’t
        wait until you are nearing graduation. By
        considering it early and often, you can make
        strategic choices throughout your program that will
        prepare you for a successful end-of-program
        experience.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >The final program requirement may be the most
          rigorous challenge of your academic
          career.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        “Planning ahead” even applies to how you’ll complete
        your program as you near the finish line. As you
        close in on your last few courses, check the&nbsp;<a

          >Student Handbook [webpage]</a
        >
        to learn about the graduation process, and make sure
        you reach out to your faculty and advisors to
        discuss your end-of-program requirements.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        If your program offers multiple options, you may
        need to choose one of them early in your plan of
        study. You should investigate the available paths,
        such as a thesis, comprehensive exam, practicum,
        eportfolio, or creative project, and identify which
        best option aligns with your goals. Check your
        Academic Plan in ecampus to confirm what’s
        available.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>⚠️ Note:</strong> Many capstone courses run
        16 weeks and must be taken after completing all
        other program requirements; They cannot be taken
        concurrently.&nbsp;

        <h2>A Note for Doctoral Students</h2>
        <p>
          <strong
            >The end-of-program requirement for doctoral
            students differs from the options available for
            master's students.</strong

        <p>
          <strong
            >The master's program is likely to include
            options for the capstone project (thesis, etc.).
            Doctoral students, however, have to complete a
            dissertation. This capstone project focuses on
            researching a relevant question in the
            discipline and articulating its significance to
            professional practice.</strong

      <h2>Identify Your Topic</h2>
      <p>
        As you move through your coursework, use assignments
        as stepping stones for your final thesis or capstone
        (or dissertation) project. When possible, choose
        topics that genuinely interest you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong>Literature reviews or research
        papers can often serve as early groundwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the toughest parts of the research process is
        narrowing your focus. By identifying a topic early
        and doing some initial research, you’ll be much
        better prepared to refine your question and dive
        deeper when it is time to develop your final
        project.

      <h2>Know Your Degree Timeline</h2>
      <p>
        APUS is different from most brick-and-mortar
        colleges and universities in that students can
        potentially take courses year-round with no breaks
        and can register online, day or night, without the
        approval of an advisor or faculty member. Sometimes
        this model can be interpreted to mean that students
        can complete their degrees in a short amount of time
        while taking classes in any order; however, it is
        important to understand the time commitments of your
        schoolwork and your life to pace yourself.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong
            >APUS offers new course sessions each month
            throughout the year.</strong
          >
          With this flexibility, plan courses in keeping
          with the requirements of your financial aid type
          and with awareness of your plans at home. &nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Your funding type may dictate your
            schedule.</strong
          >
          For example, if you are using Federal Student Aid,
          your second semester will begin immediately after
          the first ends, potentially resulting in eight
          consecutive months of coursework. By comparison,
          students using VA benefits may have more
          flexibility in scheduling, but changes in
          enrollment can lead to a lapse in coverage or
          payments. If you rely on VA benefits for living
          expenses, be sure to plan your course schedule
          carefully to maintain consistent support.
