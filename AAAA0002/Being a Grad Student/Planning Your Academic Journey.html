      <p>
        To succeed academically, it is vital to understand
        your program’s structure and requirements, as well
        as how to navigate them effectively. This will help
        you reach your graduation timeline goals.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Understand Your Degree Program</h2>
      <p>
        Be sure to learn all about your program so that you
        know what to expect and can ensure it is in
        alignment with your personal and professional goals.
        Research online and reach out to an advisor if you
        have questions. Advisors are available via phone,
        email, or live chat.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Map Your Course Path</h2>
      <p>
        As you review your program’s course requirements,
        take the time to plan

              <p>
                Taking the time to map out your course
                progression early can make a significant
                difference in your academic journey. With
                new sessions starting each month at APUS,
                you have the flexibility to build a schedule
                that aligns with your goals and personal
                commitments. Begin by carefully reviewing
                your program’s requirements and organizing
                your Core, Concentration, and Elective
                courses in a logical order (see the next
                section for more details).&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                It is also important to keep financial aid
                and registration deadlines in mind when
                planning your courses. Staying aware of
                academic year nuances and registration dates
                can help ensure your enrollment proceeds
                smoothly without unexpected obstacles.&nbsp;

                If you are unsure about the best path
                forward or have questions about sequencing
                courses, contact the Advising Team. They can
                help you create a course map tailored to
                your needs and keep you on track to meet
                your graduation goals. They can also help

                Begin your studies by registering for the
                designated first required course in the
                program, which is categorized as an
                <em>Institutional Requirement</em> on your

                The Department Chair chose this course to
                establish foundational knowledge and prepare
                students for their graduate program. This
                valuable class, which is included in most
                master’s degree plans, is key to developing
                the research skills and academic habits
                necessary for future success and smooth
                progression through subsequent

                doctoralstudies@apus.edu for assistance with
                course planning, as these degree plans are
                not laid out the same way as Master's
                students' plans. For example , you cannot
                take electives or other courses in any
                order, as there are only certain courses
                running each term.

                (as described earlier) before moving on to

                Core courses set the foundation for the more

              <p>
                Ideally, Concentration courses will be taken
                after you have satisfied all of the Core
                requirements, but before you tackle the
                final program requirement. These courses
                allow students to narrow the topic for the
                capstone thesis or project.

                A Tip from Advising
              </h3>
              <p style="text-align: center">
                Because the Core requirements are
                essentially the same across all
                Concentration options within the same
                program, we recommend completing these
                first.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: center">
                Unsure of which Concentration to choose? Not
                to worry! By starting with the Core
                requirements, you will be less likely to
                lose credit if you decide to change
                Concentrations, while still making progress
                toward degree completion.

                  more Elective courses for
                  completion</strong
                >, insert them into your schedule throughout
                your academic journey. The Electives can
                come from almost any graduate-level subject
                at APUS, as long as a prerequisite is not
                required. These courses can be a welcome
                break from the discipline and give you
                familiarity with topics you would not
                otherwise have encountered in your degree.

              <p>
                <strong>Exploring your interests?</strong>
                Electives are a great way to do that! Just
                make sure you take the Electives after your

                Concentration selection.&nbsp;

                Simply put, Electives have scheduling

      <h2>Scheduling Tip: Register Early</h2>
      <p>
        Be mindful of course availability during your time
        of study. Some specialized courses may be offered on
        a limited schedule to ensure quality classroom
        experiences. This is why it is important to map out
        your registrations 6–12 months in advance. Staying
        proactive and working with the Advising Team to
        confirm course schedules will help you maintain
        steady progress toward your degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research also shows that registering early is a key
        habit of successful students. By securing your seat
        in advance, you help ensure your payment processes
        smoothly and give yourself time to prepare for the
        academic demands ahead.

              Don’t forget to reach out to an FSA Advisor
              for help! Timely planning and registering for
              courses minimizes the risk of losing part or
              all of your financial aid eligibility.

      <h2>Maintain Momentum</h2>
      <p>
        To keep your academic momentum strong, commit to
        registering for courses consistently and doing so
        early. Successful students understand that steady
        progress is not just a habit—it’s a strategy.
        Staying enrolled and following a routine brings you
        closer to graduation, helps protect your financial
        aid, and keeps your academic record strong. Every
        course you complete adds to your growth, whereas
        unnecessary withdrawals can leave marks on your
        transcript and raise concerns with future employers.
        Approach each term with intention and determination.
        Building momentum means more than simply moving
        ahead; it is about developing a mindset of
        resilience, focus, and purpose that will guide you
        all the way to your goals.

      <h2>Be Prepared for the Time Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        While you may anticipate a workload similar to your
        undergraduate studies, keep in mind that
        graduate-level expectations are substantially
        higher. Before enrolling, it is important to
        understand the time commitment required at this
        academic level.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Master's Students should anticipate dedicating
          approximately 18–22 hours per week to each
          course.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>

          >Doctoral Students should anticipate dedicating
          approximately 25–30 hours per week to each
          course.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Being aware of and planning for this expectation in
        advance empowers you to stay organized, keep up with
        coursework, and achieve your academic goals with
        confidence.
