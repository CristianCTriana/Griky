        Succeeding in Your Courses
      </h1>

      <hr class="divider-line" />

      <p>
        Navigating your courses requires proactive
        engagement, strategic planning, and consistent
        communication. At APUS, your daily and weekly
        responsibilities closely mirror those in traditional
        institutions, but are tailored for the flexibility
        of an online, asynchronous format.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>
        🔍Weekly Course Scans &amp; Strategic Planning
      </h2>
      <p>
        Graduate courses are reading-intensive and
        task-driven, so you should begin each week with a
        clear strategy. Start by reviewing the week’s
        assignments, discussion prompts, papers, quizzes, or
        projects. These tasks reveal what your instructor
        wants you to focus on, helping you prioritize the
        most relevant readings and concepts.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Before diving into the materials, try the
        “task-first” method: read the assessment
        instructions first, then preview the readings with
        those goals in mind. This purposeful approach helps
        filter out distractions and allows you to
        concentrate on what matters most. It is a simple
        shift in preparation that can dramatically improve
        comprehension and retention.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        To stay ahead, dedicate 10–15 minutes at the start
        of each week to scan your course content and build a
        plan. Use a calendar or planner to block out time
        for each task, adjusting the time blocks based on
        the week’s workload. This habit will keep you
        organized, but not overwhelmed, by setting the tone
        for confident, focused learning.
      </p>

      <h2>💬Active Participation and Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Staying engaged with your course community is
        crucial for success.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Weekly Discussion Forums:</strong>
          Participation in discussions is required in most
          courses. The Discussion forums serve as a space
          for in-depth dialogue with instructors and
          classmates around weekly content.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1:1 Chat with Prof:</strong> This
          dedicated space allows you to send private
          messages to your instructor. Learn more about the

            [webpage].</a
          >&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Have a Question?</strong> If the question
          is course-related and might benefit others, post
          it in the open Q&amp;A chat. For private matters,
          use the 1:1 Chat with Prof.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Direct Messaging:</strong> Use the
          in-course instant messaging feature to communicate
          with your peers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h2>🗣 Connecting through Office Hours</h2>
      <p>
        In APUS's mostly asynchronous online environment,
        live office hours are an invaluable resource for
        academic and professional growth. These sessions
        enable you to ask questions about assignments, and
        they offer opportunities to build relationships with
        your instructors, gain deeper insights into course
        materials, and explore research or career
        interests.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Faculty are required to be available to students,
        even if formal office hours are not posted. Don’t
        wait for an invitation. Reach out and schedule time
        to connect. These conversations can lead to
        mentorship, letters of recommendation, and even
        collaboration on academic projects or presentations.
        The more your instructors know about your goals and
        interests, the better they can support your
        journey.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Tip: Treat office hours like networking
        appointments. Come prepared with questions, share
        your academic interests, and be open to feedback.
        Whether you are seeking clarification or exploring
        future opportunities, these meetings can be a
        turning point in your graduate experience.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>✔️Monitoring Grades and Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to always review and apply the
        feedback given to you by your instructors.
        Additionally, you should monitor your grades and
        course progress to ensure you are on track. The
        Navigating the Grades Tool [video] will help with
        this process.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>👍Staying Engaged and Committed</h2>
      <p>
        Logging in regularly, submitting assignments on
        time, and participating in discussions will all
        contribute to your academic success. In fact,
        consistent engagement is strongly linked to higher
        graduation rates. Staying enrolled and avoiding
        unnecessary withdrawals is also important, as these
        notations appear on your graduate transcript and may
        raise questions for future employers.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>🆘Seeking Help Early</h2>
      <p>
        If you encounter challenges or start to fall behind,
        reach out to your instructor early. Do not wait
        until you are completely overwhelmed. Proactive
        communication can help you create a plan to get back
        on track. Organization, communication, and
        consistency are key to academic success.&nbsp;
