        Reading Scholarly Articles
      </h1>

      <hr class="divider-line" />

      <p>
        One thing you should notice immediately when looking
        at a scholarly article is that it is divided into
        sections. (Quantitative reports tend to be laid out
        more formally than qualitative reports.) Usually,
        the sections of an article are labeled, though the
        labels may vary slightly from journal to journal.
        Also, sometimes sections may be combined, depending
        on the editorial policy of a given journal.

                The Introduction usually explains why the
                research was done. Often this section will
                identify the research question and
                theoretical framework and then present a
                short literature review.

              <p>
                The Methodology section (sometimes called
                Methods) explains how the study was
                conducted and who was being studied.&nbsp;
                It typically includes a description of the
                methods used to collect and analyze the
                study data. If it's a qualitative report,
                the researcher may discuss their role in the
                study.

              <p>
                The Results section may also be called the
                Findings section. In this section, the
                author presents a concise report of what the
                analysis discovered. Tables or figures are
                often included here to formally display the
                findings. In a qualitative report, this
                section will often include descriptions of
                and quotations from the study’s
                participants.

                implications the study might have in the
                greater context. In other words, the author
                explains what they learned and why it

              When we talk about scholarly research, what we
              are referring to are articles, books, or
              reports that are based on original research or
              experimentation. The scholars being referred
              to are typically scientists, academics, or
              other experts in a given field who are often
              connected with a college, university, or
              similar institution.
            </p>
            <p>
              [Definition by Professor Timothy C. Lim,
              California State University.]
            </p>
            <p>
              You may hear a professor refer to "the
              literature" when talking about a particular
              idea or subject area. What he or she is
              talking about are the articles, books, or
              other sources that pertain to the research
              topic under discussion. When you write a
              literature review, what you're doing is
              reviewing the literature that addresses your
              paper's research question or topic.
            </p>

              You've probably also heard the terms
              <em>quantitative</em> and
              <em>qualitative</em> in reference to research.
              Every research report should address specific
              analytical objectives, types of research
              questions, data collection methods, the types
              of data produced, and the degree of
              flexibility in the design of the study. So
              you'll want to make sure you also take note of
              the overall approach in the article you are
              reading.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quantitative research is a systematic,
              empirical investigation that uses statistical,
              mathematical, or computational techniques.
              Quantitative research looks to explain the
              causes of change. The goal is to objectively
              report. The writing in a quantitative article
              is typically impersonal and focuses purely on
              the facts of the study. No mention is made of
              the person doing the study, the problems that
              came up, or what the researcher thought about
              while the study was underway.
            </p>
            <p>
              Qualitative research is a planned, empirical
              investigation, the aim of which is to gain a
              deep understanding of a specific organization,
              event, or issue, rather than to compile a
              surface description of a large sample of a
              population by way of measurement. This
              approach typically uses unstructured,
              exploratory techniques. Qualitative research
              is concerned with understanding what is
              happening as viewed by the participants. The
              researcher is often one of those participants.
              The writing in a qualitative article may use
              the words "I" or "we" because what is being
              reported is often a process rather than a
              finding, a qualitative article may not always
              follow the section-by-section format. For this
              reason, reading qualitative reports can be
              more challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another important aspect of scholarly research
              is that it is peer-reviewed. The
              <em>Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary</em>
              defines peer review as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              "The process by which a scholarly work (such
              as a paper or research proposal) is checked by
              a group of experts in the same field to make
              sure it meets the necessary standards before
              it is published or accepted."
            </ul>
            <p>
              How this works is that an author will submit
              his or her article to a specific journal. The
              editor of that journal then relays the article
              anonymously to several experts in the author's
              field—that is, his or her peers—who critique
              the article in terms of its quality and
              accuracy. They then send their review back to
              the editor. An article that is favorably
              reviewed by these experts and the editor is
              now peer-reviewed and may be published.

              We read differently depending on what it is we
              are reading. Reading a novel or a magazine
              engages us in a different way than reading an
              academic article or book chapter. [On the
              screen is a picture of the book
              <em>Moby Dick</em> along with a whale
              graphic.] When we are reading fiction and
              really enjoying it, we can get lost in the
              storytelling, and our imagination may be
              filled with descriptions of the setting and
              characters.
            </p>
            <p>
              When reading a scholarly article, the
              experience is very different. [On the screen
              is a side-by-side comparison of
              <em>Moby Dick</em> the book and a journal
              article on whale watching.] We are reading to
              understand and to find information. Our
              approach here needs to be more analytical and
              critical.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are different ways of reading: skimming,
              scanning, extensive reading, and intensive
              reading. In scholarly research, you are likely
              to use all of these methods at different
              times.
            </p>
            <p>
              Skimming means looking over things very
              quickly to get a general idea of what the text
              is about.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scanning is similar, but here you’re looking
              for something specific—say, a particular point
              being discussed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Extensive reading is reading deeply, often
              word-for-word. Reading a novel is a kind of
              extensive reading, but the same approach can
              apply to a scholarly article you've identified
              as especially useful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Intensive reading is more focused—often used
              to gather specific information, such as when
              reviewing sources for an annotated
              bibliography or literature review.
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing you should notice immediately when
              looking at a scholarly article is that it is
              divided into sections. Quantitative reports
              tend to be laid out more formally than
              qualitative reports. Usually, the sections are
              labeled, though labels may vary slightly from
              journal to journal, and some sections may be
              combined depending on editorial policy. Here
              are the typical sections to look for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Provides a
                summary of the entire article.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Introduction:</strong> Explains why
                the research was done, identifies the
                research question and theoretical framework,
                and presents a short literature review.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Methodology (or Methods)</strong>:
                Explains how the study was conducted, who
                was studied, and what methods were used to
                collect and analyze data. In qualitative
                reports, the researcher may discuss their
                role in the study.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Results (or Findings)</strong>:
                Presents what the analysis discovered, often
                with tables or figures. Qualitative findings
                often include participant quotes and
                descriptive analysis.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Discussion</strong>: Interprets the
                results in relation to the research
                question.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Conclusion</strong>: Explains the
                study's implications and relevance.
                Sometimes combined with the discussion
                section.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>References</strong>: Lists the
                research literature consulted.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Appendices</strong>: May include
                surveys, additional data, tables, formulas,
                illustrations, or figures.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you do a Google search on how to read a
              scholarly article, you'll find many
              approaches—but most say the same thing: don’t
              read linearly like you would a novel.
            </p>
            <p>
              When reading research, you'll find it more
              useful to target certain sections first. Your
              initial goal should be to learn what the
              article is about at the general level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before you begin, make sure you have a clear
              idea in mind of your topic or research
              question. Doing this will help you decide if
              what you're reading is relevant to your
              research project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Read the abstract first. An abstract provides
              a summary of the entire article. Reading it,
              you can learn about the important concepts of
              the study without necessarily understanding
              every detail.
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing to note here is that all abstracts
              are not alike. Some are written very well and
              provide a clear synopsis of the article. Some
              are written poorly or are incomplete, which
              means you may have to read the article more
              intensively. As a rule, however, the abstract
              is intended to provide a summary. If the
              information here seems useful, move on to the
              introduction.
            </p>
            <p>
              [On the screen: Hint: The abstract is usually
              &nbsp;presented right after the title of the
              article. Sometimes it is located in a sidebar
              or second page. Articles that have been
              translated sometimes post the abstract at the
              end of the document.]
            </p>
            <p>
              Skim the introduction during this first
              read-through. Take notes or highlight
              important text as you do. What you are looking
              for is a general idea of why the research was
              done and what the research question is.
            </p>
            <p>
              Look, too, for special terms that the author
              might be using. This is important, as
              sometimes researchers will develop their own
              jargon to express the concepts they are
              studying. You'll want to take note of the
              theoretical framework being used. Sometimes
              this is explained quite clearly, but sometimes
              the author may not be as clear as you'd like.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, continue to skim-read through the
              review of the literature. Your goal here is
              not to learn about this research in depth, but
              to understand what the author thought was
              important in relation to the study.
            </p>
            <p>
              [On the screen: Hint: Sometimes the literature
              review in presented in the Introduction.]
            </p>
            <p>
              Jump over the report of the study’s findings
              and go straight to the discussion and
              conclusion sections. This is where the author
              will summarize what he or she found and how
              (or if) the research question was answered.
              This section should show how the study fits
              into the larger literature and what practical
              implications the study has, if any.
            </p>
            <p>
              After reading the discussion and conclusion,
              you should know what conclusions the
              researcher drew from the research study and
              what steps were suggested for future research.
            </p>
            <p>
              [On the screen: Hint: Recall that sometimes
              the discussion and conclusion sections are
              presented separately.]
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you've read the abstract, introduction,
              and discussion/conclusion, skim over the rest
              of the article just to make sure you've read
              it all.
