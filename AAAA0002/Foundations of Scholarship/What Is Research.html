        to understand research from the perspective of an
        APUS graduate student. To start this process, watch

              If you Google the phrase “What is research?”
              you’ll get a wide range of answers. Most of
              them tend to focus on the process and its
              purpose. Here's one definition that’s pretty
              straightforward:&nbsp;
            </p>
            <ul>
              Research is “the methodical investigation into
              a subject in order to discover facts, to
              establish or revise a theory, or to develop a
              plan of action based on the facts discovered.”
              [Encarta Dictionary: English (North America –
              Microsoft]
            </ul>
            <p>
              John Creswell, Professor of Educational
              Psychology at the University of
              Nebraska–Lincoln and instructor in mixed
              methods research, qualitative inquiry, and
              general research design, defines research
              as:&nbsp;
            </p>
            <ul>
              “A process of steps used to collect and
              analyze information to increase our
              understanding of a topic or issue.
            </ul>
            <p>
              Research is more than just finding information
              about a topic ; it is a systematic course of
              action that must be carefully planned and
              executed. Whether you are an undergraduate
              looking for resources to support an argument
              paper, or developing an original investigation
              as part of your graduate program of study, the
              major steps of research are essentially the
              same:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. You express a research question. The
              research question must be correctly stated and
              clearly defined. Deciding the research
              question is the central element of research.
              It allows you to work out the conceptual
              framework and theoretical assumptions of your
              study and write a clear thesis statement or
              hypothesis statement. The research question
              tells your readers what it is you most want to
              know. &nbsp;
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                You express a research question. The
                research question must be correctly stated
                and clearly defined. Deciding the research
                question is the central element of research.
                It allows you to work out the conceptual
                framework and theoretical assumptions of
                your study and write a clear thesis
                statement or hypothesis statement. The
                research question tells your readers what it
                is you most want to know. &nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                You collect information and data to support
                or answer your thesis statement or research
                question. You will read the professional and
                scholarly literature. Once you've
                established your research question and
                articulated your thesis statement or
                hypothesis, you re-explore that literature
                and supplement it with additional resources.
                An important component in this process of
                information review is deciding on a
                theoretical perspective.
                <p>
                  After this literature review, you explain
                  what your research approach will
                  be—quantitative, qualitative, or mixed
                  methods—and the specific investigation
                  methods you will use and why. Then you
                  collect the data and analyze it using the
                  specific techniques you've outlined in
                  your research methods section.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                You present an answer. You show your
                findings and explain how they answer the
                question your study was designed to
                investigate. Then you state your
                conclusions.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              To review then, research is a planned sequence
              of steps:&nbsp;

            <ol>
              <li>
                You need to know what your research question
                is. &nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                You need to know what a thesis statement is
                and how to write an effective one.
              </li>
              <li>
                In looking at the research literature that
                addresses your question, you need to know
                how to read those scholarly articles and
                understand how they do or don't apply to
                your study.
              </li>
              <li>
                You need to be able to use theory, also
                described as using a theoretical model, to
                frame your research work.
              </li>
              <li>
                To design your study, you will need to know
                what kind of approach best suits the
                question you are asking: quantitative,
                qualitative, or mixed methods.
              </li>
              <li>
                You will need to be able to collect and
                analyze data.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you write up the report of your
                research study, you will need to know how to
                write clearly and accurately, as well as how
                to present your writing using the correct
                editorial style guide of your academic
                field.
