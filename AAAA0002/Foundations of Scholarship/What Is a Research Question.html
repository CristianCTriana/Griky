      <p>
        Your research question is the foundation of your
        entire research process. Without a strong and
        well-defined question, your study may lack direction
        and coherence, putting the success of your research
        at risk. Watch the following video, What Is a
        Research Question?, and consider the following
        questions:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-icon">
        <li class="question-icon">
          What is the definition of a research question, and
          why is it important in the research process?
        </li>

              What is a research question? The Writing
              Center at George Mason University offers a
              helpful definition:
            </p>
            <ul>
              “A research question is a clear, focused,
              complex, and arguable question around which
              you center your research.”
            </ul>
            <p>
              [Full definition on the screen: “A research
              question is a clear, focused, concise,
              complex, and arguable question around which
              you center your research. You should ask a
              question about an issue that you are genuinely
              curious about.”]
            </p>
            <p>
              A research question is more than a paper
              topic; it’s a question that ideally captures
              your interest and curiosity. Like the "X" on a
              treasure map, the research question focuses
              and guides the entire research journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              A topic can be thought of as the subject of a
              conversation or some situation or event that
              is thought about. A research question, by
              contrast, investigates a specific aspect of a
              topic.
            </p>
            <p>
              In developing a research question, you want to
              keep in mind what it is you want to know about
              a topic. It's a given that you want to know
              more about it, but what does “more” mean? How
              do you refine your curiosity into a workable
              research question? To develop a research
              question, it helps to brainstorm by asking
              questions. The Washington University Libraries
              in St. Louis, MO, suggests these useful
              queries:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>How?</strong> How does the topic fit
                with respect to the field?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Where?</strong> Where does the topic
                take place, geographically or culturally?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>When?&nbsp;</strong>When did your
                topic become important or of issue?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Who?</strong> Who are the people
                involved or affected?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Why?</strong> Why is the topic
                important?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>What?</strong> What makes your
                research unique?&nbsp;
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These are not the only questions you can ask,
              but they give you an idea of how you need to
              be thinking when you explore what it is about
              a topic that captures your interest.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you've come up with a research question,
              it is important to determine if it is a good
              one for you to research. When we say “good,”
              what is usually meant is whether the question
              is one that is useful for conducting research.
              The Department of Psychology at California
              State University suggests these six criteria
              for determining the quality of a research
              question: First, does it answer something new?
              Second, is the question based on or does it
              build on previous research? Third, does the
              question look to the primary work of other
              researchers rather than secondary work?
              Fourth, is the research question a specific
              one? Fifth, is the question simple? And
              finally, is the research question practical in
              its feasibility?
            </p>
            <p>
              We'll take the rest of this video to cover
              each of these criteria in more detail.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of research is to advance
              knowledge, whether that means we are testing
              something in a unique way, or testing how
              well, or if, a theory predicts certain
              results, or exploring a new research
              methodology. The point is to develop our
              understanding of ourselves and our existence.
              Your research question should serve this goal
              by aiming to provide some type or degree of
              new insight.
            </p>
            <p>
              A research question that is based on an
              understanding of previous research and theory
              is much stronger and more relevant to science
              than a question that is simply inspired by
              general interest and curiosity. A study
              grounded in the theory and results of prior
              investigations is regarded more respectfully
              by other researchers. A good research question
              makes itself part of the scholarly
              conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another way of making sure that a good
              research question is based on previous
              research is to use primary or original
              research resources in developing the question.
              Journal articles and scholarly books are
              considered primary resources as they report on
              actual investigations conducted by other
              researchers. In historical research, a primary
              source is one created at the time of a given
              event. By contrast, secondary sources
              describe, summarize, analyze, evaluate, and
              are derived from or based on primary source
              materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a side note, papers written for
              undergraduate classes often rely heavily on
              secondary sources. This is because the aim of
              undergraduate education is to introduce
              students to their respective academic fields.
              At the graduate level, students are expected
              to read the primary source research.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we say a research question should be
              specific, what is meant is that the question
              should straightforwardly state what is being
              asked. The question should be jargon-free and
              clearly written.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's an example of a nonspecific research
              question: Are dogs smarter than human
              toddlers? It does include variables—(A)
              species and (B) intelligence—and it does say
              something about the direction of the
              relationship—“smarter than.” But what isn't
              said is what is meant by “smarter than.” There
              are many different ways of operationally
              defining intelligence, one of which should be
              included in this question. A better research
              question would be: Do adult dogs score higher
              than human 2-year-olds in language acquisition
              after training?
            </p>
            <p>
              A simple research question isn't a bad
              question. Keep in mind that you don't have to
              take on the big questions of your field. It's
              OK to add just a little piece to the existing
              research. Keep it simple is a good piece of
              advice, especially for students new to the
              research process. You don't want to collect a
              massive amount of data about multiple
              variables that you don't know how to interpret
              at the end. In their enthusiasm, new
              researchers often take on more than they can
              realistically handle. It's OK to do a small,
              focused study.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the same lines of keeping things simple,
              your research question needs to be a practical
              one. That is, it needs to be something you can
              complete in the time you have for it. You
              should ask yourself, "Can I really finish this
              project by the deadline? Do I have the tools,
              resources, and sample subjects to answer my
              question sufficiently?" Be realistic if you
              can't adjust your question to make things more
              manageable. Once you've worked out your
              research question, your project should begin
              to fall into place.
