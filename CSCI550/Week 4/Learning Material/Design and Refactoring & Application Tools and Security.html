        You will build upon foundational software design and
        architecture concepts, emphasizing strategies to
        develop maintainable, scalable, and efficient
        systems. By understanding and applying suitable
        design patterns, avoiding common anti-patterns, and
        organizing code effectively, software engineers can
        significantly enhance the quality and robustness of
        their solutions.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Advanced Secure Design and Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        Building on the foundational software design
        concepts introduced in Week Two, Week Four will
        expand into advanced secure design. You will explore
        design patterns and anti-patterns through a security
        lens, examining how they impact system robustness.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Secure Design Patterns </strong>
          <br />Secure design patterns are specifically
          intended to address security challenges that
          commonly arise during software development. They
          provide standardized ways to mitigate security
          risks by reinforcing good practices and enforcing
          security controls throughout the system.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Creational Patterns</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Factory Method: </strong>The
                  Factory Method pattern provides a way to
                  enforce secure object instantiation by
                  centralizing the creation logic and
                  controlling how instances are produced.
                  This can be used to avoid direct object
                  creation, ensuring that objects are
                  created with proper configurations and
                  safeguards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Builder</strong>: The Builder
                  pattern helps in creating complex objects
                  step-by-step while ensuring that sensitive
                  components or configurations are handled
                  securely. By using a Builder, the
                  construction process can incorporate
                  security controls, such as input
                  validation and parameter sanitization,
                  before assembling the final object.

class SecureConnection: 
    def __init__(self, protocol): 
        self.protocol = protocol 
 
    def connect(self): 
        return f"Connecting using {self.protocol}" 
 
class SecureConnectionFactory: 
    @staticmethod 
    def create_connection(protocol): 
        if protocol not in ["HTTPS", "SSH"]: 
            raise ValueError("Unsupported protocol") 
        return SecureConnection(protocol) 
 
# Usage

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        This example ensures that only secure protocols
        (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) are used for creating
        connections, reducing the risk of insecure
        configurations.

          <strong>Structural Patterns</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Adapter</strong>: The Adapter pattern
              can be used to bridge between secure and
              non-secure components, ensuring that sensitive
              data is appropriately transformed or
              restricted before passing through non-secure
              systems. This pattern helps in maintaining
              compatibility without compromising security
              standards.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Decorator</strong>: The Decorator
              pattern provides a flexible way to add secure
              features or functionalities to an object
              without modifying its core. It can be used to
              layer additional security checks, such as
              encryption, access control, or logging, around
              an existing component, thus enhancing security
              incrementally.

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The decorator adds an encryption layer to the data
        processing, ensuring sensitive information is
        protected.

        <li>
          <strong>Behavioral Patterns</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Observer</strong>: The Observer
              pattern allows multiple objects to be notified
              of changes in a subject while ensuring that
              sensitive data is protected. Using
              security-conscious observers helps ensure that
              only authorized components receive updates,
              and that communication is encrypted to prevent
              interception.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Strategy</strong>: The Strategy
              pattern can be applied to dynamically select
              secure algorithms or communication protocols
              based on context. For example, different
              encryption strategies can be applied depending
              on data sensitivity, enhancing flexibility
              while maintaining a high level of security.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security Anti-Patterns </strong><br />
          Anti-patterns are common but flawed approaches
          that can introduce vulnerabilities. Understanding
          these anti-patterns helps developers avoid costly
          mistakes and improve overall system robustness.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Hardcoded Secrets</strong>: One of the
              most frequent and dangerous anti-patterns is
              embedding sensitive information, such as
              passwords or API keys, directly in the code.
              This practice exposes secrets to potential
              attackers, especially if the code is shared
              publicly or across multiple teams. Instead,
              secure secret management tools or environment
              variables should be used to store and retrieve
              sensitive information safely.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>God Object</strong>: The God Object
              anti-pattern occurs when a single class
              becomes overly central, accumulating excessive
              responsibilities. This concentration of logic
              makes the object a critical point of failure
              and an attractive target for attackers. By
              decentralizing the logic, following Single
              Responsibility Principle (SRP), and splitting
              the functionality across multiple cohesive
              classes, security and maintainability can be
              greatly improved.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Golden Hammer</strong>: The Golden
              Hammer anti-pattern represents the misuse of
              familiar solutions in scenarios where they are
              not appropriate. Repeatedly applying a known
              solution—without consideration for security
              requirements—can lead to significant
              vulnerabilities. For instance, using the same
              authentication mechanism for different
              modules, regardless of their specific security
              needs, could expose sensitive areas of the
              application to risk. Tailoring solutions to
              meet the specific security needs of each
              context is crucial for a robust system design.
