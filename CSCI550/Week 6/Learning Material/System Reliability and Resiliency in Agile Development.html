        4. System Reliability and Resiliency in Agile
        Development
      </h1>

      <hr class="divider-line" />

      <p>
        Reliability and resiliency are essential components
        of any modern software system, especially those that
        operate at scale or in critical environments. Agile
        frameworks must adapt to include practices that
        enhance these attributes.
      </p>
      <h2>Advanced Resiliency Design Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        To build systems that can gracefully handle
        unexpected disruptions, Agile teams should integrate
        advanced resiliency design patterns. These patterns
        are architectural strategies designed to improve
        system reliability and minimize the impact of
        failures.
      </p>

        <li>
          <span
            ><strong>Circuit Breakers</strong>: A
            <strong>circuit breaker</strong> is a design
            pattern that helps prevent cascading failures by
            stopping the flow of requests to a component
            that is experiencing failures. When a system
            detects that a particular service is repeatedly
            failing, the circuit breaker “trips” and
            prevents further attempts until the service is
            likely to be functioning properly again. This
            helps to maintain overall system stability and
            avoids exhausting resources on doomed
            operations.</span

        <li>
          <span
            ><strong>Bulkheads</strong>: The<strong>
              bulkhead</strong
            >
            pattern is used to isolate different parts of
            the system, much like compartments on a ship. By
            compartmentalizing services or components, a
            failure in one part does not propagate
            throughout the entire system. This improves
            system resiliency by limiting the impact of a
            single component’s failure.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            ><strong>Retry Mechanisms</strong>:
            <strong>Retry mechanisms</strong> involve
            attempting failed operations again after a
            specified delay. This design pattern helps
            address transient issues that may cause failures
            temporarily, such as network hiccups or resource
            contention. By incorporating retry mechanisms,
            systems can recover from brief disruptions
            without manual intervention.</span
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These patterns help ensure that the system can
        tolerate individual component failures and continue
        operating in a degraded but functional state,
        thereby improving overall system reliability.

              This example implements a circuit breaker
              pattern to prevent cascading failures by

      <h2>Proactive Incident Management</h2>
      <p>
        Proactive incident management is essential for
        maintaining system reliability. Agile teams should
        adopt practices that allow them to learn from
        incidents and continuously improve their processes
        and systems.

          <span
            ><strong>Incident Post-Mortems</strong>:
            Conducting
            <strong>incident post-mortems</strong> after
            system failures is crucial for identifying the
            root cause and preventing similar incidents in
            the future. The goal of a post-mortem is to
            document what happened, why it happened, and
            what can be done to prevent recurrence. By
            taking a blameless approach, teams can focus on
            learning from the incident rather than assigning
            blame, fostering a culture of continuous
            improvement.</span

        <li>
          <span
            ><strong>Blameless Retrospectives</strong
            >:<strong> Blameless retrospectives</strong> are
            Agile ceremonies in which the team reviews
            incidents and issues that occurred during the
            sprint. The goal is to identify what went well,
            what could be improved, and how the team can
            enhance system reliability moving forward. By
            keeping these retrospectives blameless, team
            members feel safe discussing mistakes and
            sharing ideas for improvement, which ultimately
            leads to more resilient systems.</span

          <span
            ><strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong>
            and<strong> Early Detection</strong>:
            Implementing continuous monitoring and alerting
            systems enables teams to detect issues before
            they escalate into major incidents. Tools like
            <strong>Prometheus</strong>,<strong>
              Grafana</strong
            >, or <strong>New Relic</strong> can be
            integrated into Agile workflows to provide
            real-time insights into system performance and
            reliability metrics, allowing teams to act
            proactively.</span
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Proactive incident management allows Agile teams to
        evolve their practices, strengthen their systems,
        and ensure that reliability remains a central focus
        of their development efforts.
