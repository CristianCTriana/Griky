              Distributed teams often handle sensitive user
              data, which raises ethical concerns regarding
              data privacy and protection. Ensuring that all

              Working across different locations can lead to
              discrepancies in how team members are treated.
              For instance, certain team members might be
              left out of important decisions due to time
              zone differences, or there may be cultural
              misunderstandings that affect collaboration.

      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 19px"
          >Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly
          being used in software development to enhance
          productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and
          support decision-making. However, using AI in DASD
          requires careful consideration of ethical

      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 19px"
          ><strong>Bias in AI Models</strong>: One of the
          major ethical concerns with using AI is the
          potential for bias in AI models. Distributed teams
          must ensure that AI tools and models are trained
          on diverse datasets to minimize biases that could
          lead to unfair outcomes. Regular audits of AI
          models and involving team members from different
          cultural backgrounds in the development process
          can help identify and mitigate biases.</span

      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 19px"
          ><strong>Transparency and Accountability</strong>:
          AI systems used in DASD should be transparent, and
          team members should understand how AI-driven
          decisions are made. This includes documenting the
          data sources, algorithms, and decision-making
          processes used by AI systems. Transparency helps
          build trust among stakeholders and ensures that AI
          is used responsibly.</span

          ensure that data used for AI development is
          anonymized and that individuals’ privacy rights

          is important to maintain human oversight to ensure
          that AI-driven processes align with ethical
          standards. Distributed teams should establish
