            </p>
            <p>
              You are about to embark on an exciting journey
              that will transform the way you think about
              human resources and its critical role in
              organizational success. In this course, we
              will dive deep into the world of HR policies
              and strategies. But this isn't just about
              memorizing rules and regulations. It's about
              understanding the profound impact that
              well-crafted HR policies can have on people's
              lives and on the success of entire
              organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
              From navigating the complexities of employment
              law to mastering the art of talent management,
              from ensuring workplace safety to mediating
              conflicts, you will gain the skills to become
              a true HR champion. You will learn how to
              balance the needs of a multi-generational
              workforce, protect employee privacy in the
              digital age, and align HR strategies with
              organizational goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the end of this course, you won't just
              understand HR policies – you will be equipped
              to create and implement strategies that can
              transform workplaces, empower employees, and
              drive organizational success.
            </p>
            <p>
              So get ready to challenge your assumptions,
              expand your horizons, and become the kind of
              HR professional who doesn't just follow best
              practices, but sets them!
            </p>
            <p>
              Are you ready to redefine what HR can be?
              Let's get started on this exciting journey
              together!

        1.1 Evolution of Software Development Life Cycle
        (SDLC) Models
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a
        structured process used to develop software,
        consisting of different phases that guide the
        creation, testing, deployment, and maintenance of
        software systems (Sabharwal et al., 2021). Over
        time, SDLC models have evolved to address
        technological advancements, changing customer needs,
        and organizational challenges.

            Waterfall Model
          </label>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              The <strong>Waterfall Model</strong> is one of
              the earliest SDLC models, which follows a
              linear and sequential approach. It consists of
              distinct phases, such as requirements
              gathering, system design, implementation,
              testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each
              phase must be completed before moving to the
              next. The Waterfall Model ensures thorough
              documentation and planning, but its rigidity
              makes it less effective for projects where
              requirements are expected to change during
              development (Hooda et al., 2023).

            V-Model
          </label>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              The <strong>V-Model</strong> is similar to the
              Waterfall Model but emphasizes verification
              and validation. In this model, each
              development phase is paired with a
              corresponding testing phase. For example,
              requirements gathering is followed by
              acceptance testing, and system design is
              paired with system testing. The V-Model
              improves upon the Waterfall approach by
              integrating testing throughout the development
              process, but it still struggles with adapting
              to changing requirements (Sabharwal et al.,
              2021).

            Iterative and Incremental Model
          </label>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              As software systems became more complex, a
              more flexible approach was needed. The
              Iterative and Incremental Model involves
              building software in small parts, allowing
              developers to revisit and refine features in
              cycles. Each iteration includes planning,
              designing, coding, and testing, resulting in
              an increment—a piece of the final product.
              This approach enhances risk management and
              allows for client feedback throughout the
              process, unlike the rigid Waterfall Model
              (Hooda et al., 2023).

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              <strong>Agile</strong> methodologies focus on
              adaptability and customer collaboration.
              Unlike the previous models, Agile is not a
              single method but a mindset that emphasizes
              iterative progress, responsiveness to change,
              and customer satisfaction. Agile methods use
              continuous feedback, short iterations, and
              small cross-functional teams. Common Agile
              frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme
              Programming (XP). Agile aims to make software
              development an evolving process rather than a
              fixed plan (Sabharwal et al., 2021).

              <strong>DevOps</strong> is the latest

              focus on collaboration, DevOps emphasizes
              teamwork between development and operations,
              as well as continuous integration and
              continuous deployment (CI/CD). DevOps
              automates software delivery, optimizes
              productivity, and shortens feedback loops,
              making the development and operational
              processes more efficient (Tosi, 2023).

          Additionally, machine learning algorithms are used
          to provide predictive analytics in project
          management, offering better estimates for
          timelines and risks.

          With the growing importance of cybersecurity, the

          DevSecOps integrates security throughout the

          early. Given the increasing number of data

          Agile emphasizes responsiveness, which means
          software teams must handle rapidly changing
          requirements. Balancing agility with stability can
          be challenging, as too many changes can create
          ambiguity, affect timelines, and cause scope creep

      <h2>1.3 Best Practices in Software Development</h2>
      <p>
        Given the evolution of models, industry trends, and
        challenges, it is important for software teams to
        adopt best practices that promote efficiency,
        maintainability, and scalability. Here are some best
        practices to consider:

              Deployment (CI/CD):</strong
            >
            Automated CI/CD pipelines allow teams to
            integrate code frequently and deploy it with
            minimal manual intervention. This reduces
            integration risks and makes frequent delivery
            possible <br /><br /><em>(Tosi, 2023).</em>

            <strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD):</strong>
            In Test-Driven Development, developers write
            tests before writing the actual code. TDD
            ensures that the code is covered by tests,
            reducing bugs, and making the system easier to
            refactor <br /><br /><em

            Code reviews help maintain code quality and
            share knowledge among team members.
            <strong>Pair programming</strong>, where two
            developers work together on the same code, is an
            Agile technique that promotes collaboration and
            quality <br /><br /><em

            While Agile emphasizes working software over
            documentation, some documentation—such as
            architectural blueprints and well-structured
            README files—is essential for maintainability.
            Tools like <strong>Confluence</strong> and
            <strong>Notion</strong> help teams share
            knowledge and collaborate <br /><br /><em

            Regular refactoring is crucial for managing
