        System-level power management involves strategies
        and techniques implemented at the operating system
        and hardware level to optimize power consumption

      <h3>Power States and Transitions&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>
        Modern computing systems utilize a variety of power
        states and transitions to manage energy consumption
        effectively. These states are defined by the
        Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)
        specification:

        Transitions between different power states are
        crucial for managing power efficiently. The system
        can transition from working to sleep based on user
        activity or system settings, and this process
        involves notifying applications and drivers before
        entering the sleep state. When transitioning from
        sleep to working, the system can wake up in response
        to user activity or predefined wake-up events. The
        time it takes to wake depends on the sleep state,
        with lower-powered states like S3 taking longer to
        resume. Transitioning from working to hibernate
        involves saving the system state to a hibernation
        file before powering down, which helps conserve
        power while preserving the system state. Resuming
        from hibernation, which involves restoring the
        system state from the hibernation file, typically
        takes longer than waking from sleep but is more
        power-efficient. These transitions are key to
        optimizing power management in modern systems.

      <h3>Dynamic Power Management</h3>
      <p>
        Dynamic Power Management (DPM) techniques are
        crucial for optimizing power consumption in modern
        computing systems. These techniques involve
        selectively shutting down or reducing the power of
        system components when they are idle or
        underutilized. The following are key points to know
        about DPM:

                Timeout Policies: These involve setting a
                timeout period after which a device enters a
                low-power state if it remains idle. The
                timeout can be fixed or adaptive, with the
                latter adjusting based on previous idle
                periods to optimize power savings.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                Predictive Policies: These predict the
                length of upcoming idle periods to decide
                whether to transition to a low-power state.
                This approach can be more efficient than
                timeout policies as it reduces unnecessary
                waiting times.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                Stochastic Policies: These model power state
                transitions as stochastic processes,
                optimizing power savings while considering
                performance delays. They are robust but
                require accurate modeling of request
                patterns.

      <h3>Energy-Aware Scheduling</h3>
      <p>
        Energy-aware scheduling algorithms play a crucial
        role in optimizing power management in
        high-performance computing (HPC) systems by
        balancing performance and energy consumption. These
        algorithms can be categorized into various types,
        including machine learning-based, dynamic
        programming, fuzzy logic, integer programming,
        randomized algorithms, evolutionary algorithms, and
        constraint programming, each offering a unique
        approach to optimizing energy usage while
        maintaining performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary goals of these algorithms are to
        minimize execution time, energy consumption, and
        power usage, with some focusing on metrics like
        Energy Delay Product (EDP) or Energy Delay Sum
        (EDS), which combine time and energy considerations.
        Common mechanisms employed in these algorithms
        include Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling
        (DVFS), Dynamic Power Management (DPM), and power
        capping, with DVFS being particularly popular for
        dynamically adjusting power and performance. These
        algorithms are integral to dynamic power management
        strategies, helping determine when to scale down
        power usage or turn off components to save energy
        without significantly impacting performance. In
        real-time systems, energy-aware scheduling ensures
        power consumption is managed while meeting strict
        timing constraints, achieved by dynamically
        adjusting the power states of processors based on
        the current workload and system state.&nbsp;
