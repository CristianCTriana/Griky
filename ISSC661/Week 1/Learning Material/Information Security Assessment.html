        Information Security Assessment
      </h1>

      <hr class="divider-line" />

      <p>
        An information security assessment begins with
        determining the scope of the systems that need to be
        evaluated. By doing so, it ensures that the
        assessment aligns with the organization’s intended
        objectives and requirements. Important data and
        systems must be identified so that the risk and
        threat posed to them can be determined.
      </p>
      <div class="summary-box">
        <p>
          Methodologies are used as a way to assess risk and
          to evaluate the effectiveness of an organization’s
          security controls, policies, and procedures. A
          comprehensive security assessment often involves
          the use of multiple methodologies, such as
          vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and
          risk analysis, to examine how a weakness can be
          exploited and what consequences could result
          <em>(Death, 2023)</em>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Vulnerability scanning involves the use of automated
        tools to detect known weaknesses in the system,
        while penetration testing uses simulated attacks to
        determine how a defense responds under pressure.
        Lastly, risk analysis examines the likelihood of
        attack and the potential impact.

            >Critical thinking is deeply relevant to the
            ability to evaluate methodologies such as
            vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and
            risk analysis in both academic and professional
            contexts, while also extending into everyday
            life. In coursework, critical thinking allows
            students to move beyond memorizing definitions
            and instead analyze the strengths, limitations,
            and implications of different security
            assessment approaches. In careers, especially in
            cybersecurity and risk management, professionals
            must interpret complex data, prioritize threats,
            and make sound decisions about which
            vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk to
            organizational assets. In life, individuals
            apply the same reasoning skills when assessing
            personal risks, whether deciding how to protect
            their digital identity, weighing financial
            choices, or anticipating the consequences of
            everyday actions. Thus, critical thinking acts
            as the bridge that connects technical
            methodologies to informed judgment, enabling
            people to assess risks, evaluate evidence, and
            make decisions that are both effective and
            responsible.</span

      <p>
        Information security assessments should be conducted
        regularly so that organizations are aware of changes
        that might occur in the system and can strengthen
        their security posture. Assessments also ensure
        compliance with regulatory standards. Bottom line:
        security assessments are not a one-time event and
        should be conducted as part of a continuous cycle to
        maintain resilience.
