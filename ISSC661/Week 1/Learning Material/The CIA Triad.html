        The central model used for information security is
        known as the CIA triad (Death, 2023). The CIA triad
        defines the central objectives of confidentiality,
        integrity, and availability.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              Confidentiality ensures that sensitive
              information is accessible only to those who
              are authorized to access it. This is often
              done through encryption or another access
              control (Death, 2023). An example of
              confidentiality would be the need of
              encryption by a doctor’s office pertaining to
              patient records that are both stored and data
              that is transmitted.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              Integrity is the principle that ensures data
              remains accurate and consistent with policy.
              This is most often done with techniques such
              as digital signatures or hashing to illustrate
              that data has not been tampered with (Death,
              2023). An example of integrity would be an
              electronic signature used on loan documents.
              Before the signature is applied, the system
              would generate a unique hash of the document.
              Anything changed after the signature would
              alter the hash.

            <p>
              Availability guarantees that data and systems
              are accessible when needed (Death, 2023). This
              often requires redundancy or a backup and a
              means of a continuity of operations. An
              example of availability would be having
              multiple servers that create backups of data
              so that in the event of an interruption,
              access is still available.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              (0:00) In this lesson we'll look at
              fundamental concepts that underpin the world
              of information security. Let's dive in.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:07) Information security, often referred to
              as infosec, is all about safeguarding data
              resources from unauthorized access, attacks,
              theft, or damage. Data can be vulnerable at
              rest, in transit, or during processing. To
              ensure secure information, we focus on
              confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
            </p>
            <h3>CIA Triad</h3>
            <p>
              (0:28) We use the CIA Triad. First,
              confidentiality: this means that information
              can only be accessed by authorized
              individuals. Second, integrity ensures that
              data remains unaltered and is only modified by
              authorized parties. Third, availability: this
              means information must be readily accessible
              to those authorized to use it.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:51) These three principles form the
              backbone of information security. As security
              specialists, you'll find you're always seeking
              the best balance of all three components.
            </p>
            <h3>Access Control</h3>
            <p>
              (1:02) An access control system ensures that
              an information system meets the goals of the
              CIA Triad. Access control dictates how
              subjects like users, devices, or processes
              interact with objects like networks, servers,
              databases, apps, or files.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:18) Modern access control is implemented
              through identity and access management (IAM),
              consisting of four main processes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Identification: creating unique accounts for
                users, devices, or processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Authentication: proving the identity of
                subjects through credentials.
              </li>
              <li>
                Authorization: determining and enforcing
                rights for subjects on resources.
              </li>
              <li>
                Accounting: tracking authorized resource
                usage and detecting unauthorized access.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              (1:44) Access control is essential for both
              people and systems, ensuring that only
              legitimate actions are permitted.
            </p>
            <h3>Non-Repudiation</h3>
            <p>
              (1:58) Some security models and researchers
              identify other properties of secure systems.
              The most important of these is
              non-repudiation.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:00) Non-repudiation means a person can't
              deny doing something, such as creating,
              modifying, or sending a resource. For example,
              providing proof of authenticity and integrity
              of data that's sent or received.
            </p>
            <h3>Gap Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              (2:14) Gap analysis is a process that assesses
              how well an organization's security systems
              align with a cybersecurity framework. Security
              functions have specific goals achieved through
              security controls.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:27) To select the right controls,
              organizations use frameworks to guide them.
              Frameworks provide structure and guidance for
              security programs. Gap analysis identifies
              deviations from framework requirements and
              recommends remediation, helping organizations
              maintain cybersecurity, meet compliance
              requirements, and prioritize investments.
            </p>
            <h3>Zero Trust</h3>
            <p>
              (2:48) Zero trust is a security model that
              treats all devices, users, and services as
              untrusted, regardless of location within or
              outside the network's perimeter. This model
              relies on fundamental concepts for
              comprehensive security, including adaptive
              identity, threat scope reduction, and
              policy-driven access control.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:10) Adaptive identity recognizes that
              identities change and need continuous
              verification. Threat scope reduction limits
              access to resources on a need-to-know basis,
              reducing attack surfaces. Policy-driven access
              control enforces access restrictions based on
              user identity, device posture, and network
              context.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:32) Zero trust separates the control plane
              and data plane for flexibility and
              scalability. In a zero trust architecture, the
              control plane manages policies and
              authorization, while the data plane handles
              secure data transfer. Separating these planes
              enhances flexibility and security, allowing
              for granular control and continuous
              monitoring.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              (4:04) And that's it for this lesson. In this
              lesson, we introduced you to fundamental
              information security concepts. We first looked
              at information security applied through the
              CIA Triad. Then we discussed access control,
              which establishes how subjects interact with
              objects in a system.
            </p>

              (4:21) Next, we talked about gap analysis and
              how it helps you know where to improve your
              security programs. We finished this lesson by
              reviewing zero trust security concepts and how
              those concepts are applied through control
              planes and data planes in a zero trust model.
