        There are many advantages to implementing
        cybersecurity governance, risk management, and
        compliance (GRC). Governance is the framework in
        which cybersecurity aligns with business objectives,
        ensuring accountability and oversight in order to
        manage threats, protect business interests, and
        maintain operations (Edwards & Weaver, 2024).
        Governance involves setting policies, assigning
        roles, and integrating cybersecurity into all
        decisions being made. On the other hand, risk
        management is the process of identifying, assessing,
        and mitigating threats to digital assets. Lastly,
        compliance ensures that organizations meet legal and
        regulatory obligations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and
        PCI-DSS, to name a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        Effective cybersecurity governance requires more
        than technical controls; it demands strategic
        leadership. Edwards and Weaver (2024) argued that
        governance must be entrenched in the organizational
        culture, supported by executive leadership, and have
        board-level oversight. Continuous monitoring,
        documentation, and training are needed to maintain
        adherence. GRC is not a one-time initiative and
        requires continuous improvement, adaptation, and
        strategic alignment (Edwards & Weaver, 2024).

        board-level oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several governance frameworks that provide
        structured approaches to policy development, risk
        assessment, and performance measurement (Edwards &
        Weaver, 2024). Governance also involves ethical
        considerations, such as transparency,
        accountability, and respect for user privacy. By
        aligning cybersecurity with business goals,
        governance ensures that security investments support
        long-term resilience and deliver value for the
        financial outlay. Governance should not be just
        about control, but about fostering innovation while
        managing risk. Governance provides the strategic
        compass that guides cybersecurity efforts across the
        organization.

            <p>
              (0:00) Let's talk about GRC: Governance, Risk
              and Compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:04) So this is something that a lot of
              organizations struggle with.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:06) And while there are many reasons for
              that, one of the biggest is that there's a
              diffusion of responsibility across each one of
              those domains.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:14) Now, when we think about that when
              we're building technical models and we're
              trying to validate, govern, check for
              risk—this gets infinitely more complicated as
              the diffusion of responsibility expands to
              technical teams, legal teams, lines of
              business.

              (0:31) Let me show you what I mean by that. We
              have our governance team.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:35) If they're building a model, they're
              concerned about governance structure, the
              model validation, where are we getting things?
            </p>
            <p>(0:42) How are we auditing?</p>
            <p>
              (0:43) That's going to be your risk manager.
            </p>
            <p>(0:45) Your model risk manager.</p>
            <h3>Workflow</h3>
            <p>
              (0:47) We also have our chief privacy officer,
              our chief compliance officer and our CISO, who
              are all worried about data privacy.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Governance</h3>
            <p>
              (0:56) So their concerns are going to be the
              privacy, security compliance piece of this.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:00) Now, on the other hand, we also have to
              think about how we're organizing and managing
              our data.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:06) So that's where a chief data officer or
              a data engineer comes in, and they're worried
              about creating governed, quality-checked
              assets, and they're thinking about data
              lineage.
            </p>
            <h3>AI Teams</h3>
            <p>
              (1:19) Then we also have our Build AI team.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:23) So these are the individuals that are
              data scientists.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:27) They're mostly concerned with how are
              we looking at the data and what models are we
              creating from it.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:35) On the other end of the spectrum, we've
              got the Deploy AI team.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:39) So they're the ones that are taking
              this from the data scientists and they're
              scaling it into production.
            </p>
            <h3>Workflow</h3>
            <p>
              (1:45) They're also running the models again
              and making sure they're up to compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:50) And then finally, we have our data
              management team—AI management team—who is very
              concerned about keeping up with the tenets of
              a trustworthy AI model.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:02) And when you look at this holistically,
              it's an absolute mess.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:06) So no wonder why nobody really wants to
              touch governance, risk and compliance. Right?
            </p>
            <p>(2:10) It's going to be a political mess.</p>
            <p>(2:12) How do you assign accountability?</p>
            <p>
              (2:14) How do you make sure that overall we
              are governed and we are always in control and
              monitoring our risk?
            </p>
            <p>(2:22) Let me show you how.</p>
            <p>
              (2:23) So if we start with our governance, as
              we always do, and we're thinking about our
              model validation, where we're getting our data
              sources from, right?
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:33) We create a nice two-way connection
              between these two groups where we're sharing
              data, we're accounting for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:39) So there's already this automated,
              auditing workflow that's built in.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:43) So you're always within your privacy
              and security and compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:47) Now, if we are looking down below at
              how we are building our models, we want to
              make sure that we are testing and validating
              here.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:58) Before we go into production, we want
              to make sure that we are within compliance so
              that lies within this risk category.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:05) But then once we are in production, we
              also want to make sure that we are validating
              our models to make sure that they are still
              accurate, that they're unbiased.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:14) All of these things that we've touched
              on previously.
            </p>
            <p>(3:17) So the robustness as well.</p>
            <p>
              (3:20) Now, finally, we want to make sure that
              we are communicating correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:29) So as we are tracking compliance and
              risk, we are making sure that we are still
              pulling from these fully qualified data
              assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:37) We also want to make sure that we are
              updating our governance structure to say "Yes,
              this model has been checked. It's been checked
              recently, it's been rechecked. We are still
              within compliance."
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:47) So we're creating this workflow where
              we're sharing across different parts of the
              organization to first build the model and then
              deploy it with safe, trusted government
              assets.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              (4:04) And this is how you create a governance
              risk and compliance structure for your trusted
              AI models.
