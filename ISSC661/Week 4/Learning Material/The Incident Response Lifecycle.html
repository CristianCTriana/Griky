        Edwards and Weaver (2024) outlined a comprehensive
        incident response lifecycle comprising preparation,
        detection, analysis, containment, eradication,
        recovery, and post-incident review.

        Playbooks and predefined procedures are important,
        as is testing them regularly (Johansen, 2025).
        Goldschmidt (2025) added a strategic layer,
        proposing a capability development model that aligns

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              (0:06) So you've just seen something strange.
              Perhaps the logs on your VPN server show a
              user who's sitting right next to you has also
              just logged in from Hong Kong.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:15) Or someone on your customer service
              team notes they can see an accounting file
              that no one should have access to. Something
              strange has definitely happened.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:23) Is that strange thing a cyber incident?
              How do you decide and what do you need to do
              in case you decide that it is?
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:30) Just about anything—from discovering
              malware to identifying suspicious user
              activity—could be legally defined as a cyber
              incident under HIPAA security regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:40) So how do you know when it's time to
              implement a full incident response plan?
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:46) The correct answer is that it's always
              time to implement your incident response plan.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Elements</h3>
            <p>
              (0:51) Let's go over the key elements of an
              incident response plan and important things to
              consider when you think you may have been the
              target of a cyber attack.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:00) Incident response is typically broken
              down into six phases:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Preparation</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Identification</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Containment</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Eradication</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Recovery</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              (1:11) Most organizations mainly focus on
              containment, eradication, and recovery—and
              completely skip lessons learned. But the truth
              is, this last phase is potentially one of the
              most important.
            </p>
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <p>
              (1:27) Preparation is as straightforward as
              making sure you have a trained incident
              response team—either employed, on retainer, or
              at least someone's business card so you know
              who to call.
            </p>
            <h3>Identification</h3>
            <p>
              (1:42) An incident is initially identified in
              any number of ways, leading you to start your
              response plan with only slight awareness of
              what the incident may be.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:51) The identification phase is meant to
              clear this part up. This phase also includes
              the investigation of the depth of the
              compromise, its source, and its success or
              failure.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:01) Identification is done through a review
              of log files—lots and lots of log files. The
              important consideration at this point is not
              to disrupt any potential evidence of the
              incident.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:14) A well-trained and equipped response
              team will be able to rapidly parse log files,
              review forensic images, and do so without
              damaging any evidence in the process.
            </p>
            <h3>Containment</h3>
            <p>
              (2:28) Containment often happens concurrently
              with identification or immediately following.
              Damaged systems are removed from production,
              devices are isolated, and compromised accounts
              are locked down.
            </p>
            <p>(2:41) The bleeding stops here.</p>
            <h3>Eradication</h3>
            <p>
              (2:49) Eradication is exactly what it sounds
              like—removing and remediating any damage
              discovered in the identification phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:57) This is normally done by restoring
              systems from backup and re-imaging workstation
              systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:02) It's important to note that proper
              eradication of a cyber infection should be
              done by trained professionals and should only
              be done after comprehensive investigation of
              the incident is completed.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:13) Time and time again, small
              organizations will be quick to delete,
              restore, and re-image after the first sign of
              an incident—before they've learned how the
              attacker got in or how much damage was really
              done.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:24) In many cases, when systems are reset
              so quickly, the organization has no way of
              going back to learn what happened and, as a
              result, is often hit by the same type of
              attack again and again.
            </p>
            <h3>Recovery</h3>
            <p>
              (3:40) Recovery is the testing of the fixes in
              the eradication phase and the transition back
              to normal operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:44) Vulnerabilities are remediated,
              compromised accounts have passwords changed or
              removed altogether and replaced with more
              secure methods of access.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:55) Functionality is tested and day-to-day
              business resumes.
            </p>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>
              (4:04) The last phase is one that many
              organizations skip, but it's arguably the most
              important to prevent future incidents.
            </p>
            <p>
              (4:12) Lessons learned involve reviewing the
              steps that were taken during each phase and
              improving both your incident response
              capability and your security footprint.
            </p>
            <p>
              (4:21) If you rush to get back up and running
              but never stop to consider the implications of
              what caused the security incident, you may
              never improve your cybersecurity standing.
            </p>
            <p>
              (4:34) Whether it was human error, security
              holes, or flaws in a security product, your
              organization should review what went wrong and
              use the incident as a stepping stone to work
              toward a solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              (4:40) Without this stage, you may find
              yourself running back through these steps
              again and again with every subsequent
              preventable incident.
            </p>
            <h3>What Now</h3>
            <p>
              (4:56) Incident responses are best performed
              by persons trained and equipped for it, with
              proven processes and full support from
              leadership within the business.
            </p>
            <p>
              (5:05) In addition, with the advent of cyber
              insurance, it's becoming more and more common
              for a full response to be required before
              settlement can be made.
            </p>

            Preparation involves creating policies, training
            staff, and establishing communication protocols.
            An incident response plan (IRP) is the
            cornerstone of preparedness. IRPs should be
            aligned with business objectives and regulatory
            requirements.

            An IRP should also evolve through capability
            assessments and a gap analysis so that
            organizations assess their current state,
            desired capabilities, and targeted improvements
            (Goldschmidt, 2025).

            Overall, a fully developed IRP ensures that when
            an incident occurs, the response is swift,
            coordinated, and effective.

            Detection is the first technical step in

            Analysis involves understanding the scope,
            impact, and root cause of the incident. Digital
            forensics plays a critical role here through
            memory analysis, disk imaging, and log
            correlation (Johansen, 2025).

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0; text-align: justify">
            Analysis is linked to capability maturation, as
            investing in tools and training enables
            organizations to grow and overcome incidents
            more quickly (Goldschmidt, 2025). Ultimately,
            timely and accurate analysis better informs
            containment decisions (Edwards & Weaver, 2024).

              Containment aims to isolate affected systems
              and prevent further damage and can be done
              through network segmentation, account
              suspension, or service shutdowns (Edwards &
              Weaver, 2024). However, containment strategies
              should be based on incident severity and
              business impact.

              On the other hand, eradication involves
              removing the threat from the environment. This
              can be done through methods such as malware
              removal, patching vulnerabilities, and
              cleaning infected files (Johansen, 2025).

              It is critical that the root causes be
