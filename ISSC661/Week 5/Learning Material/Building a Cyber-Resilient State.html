          Sustainable security requires a holistic view
          (Bobrova et al., 2024). A SWOT analysis can be
          used to identify strengths, weaknesses,
          opportunities, and threats. A SWOT analysis can be
          used as a strategic tool to help prioritize
          interventions and allocate resources effectively.

              (0:00) A SWOT analysis is a strategic planning
              tool used by individuals and organizations to
              identify internal strengths and weaknesses and
              external opportunities and threats.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:10) This framework helps provide a
              comprehensive understanding of both internal
              and external factors that can affect
              decision-making and strategic planning.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:19) By categorizing factors into strengths,
              weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, SWOT
              analysis helps organizations make informed
              decisions and develop strategic plans that
              leverage their advantages while addressing
              challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:31) Let's look at each step in a SWOT
              analysis one at a time.
            </p>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>
              (0:34) Firstly, the S in SWOT stands for
              strengths. Strengths are internal
              characteristics that give an organization or
              individual an advantage over others.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:42) These can include assets, capabilities,
              resources, or qualities that contribute
              positively to achieving goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:50) For example, a company with a strong
              brand reputation, a skilled workforce, or
              advanced technology can consider these as
              strengths.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:57) Identifying strengths helps
              organizations understand where they excel and
              how they can use these assets to gain a
              competitive edge.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:06) For instance, a tech company known for
              its innovative products can leverage its
              strong research and development team as a
              major strength to continue producing
              cutting-edge technology.
            </p>
            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>
              (1:18) Next, the W in SWOT stands for
              weaknesses. Weaknesses are internal factors
              that place an organization or individual at a
              disadvantage compared to others.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:27) These may include resource limitations,
              skill gaps, outdated technology, or other
              areas that hinder performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:34) Acknowledging weaknesses is crucial for
              understanding where improvements are needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:38) For example, a company that struggles
              with customer service due to understaffing can
              identify this as a weakness and work on hiring
              and training more employees to address the
              issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:49) Recognizing weaknesses enables
              organizations to create strategies that
              mitigate these negative aspects, preventing
              them from impacting future success.
            </p>
            <h3>Opportunities</h3>
            <p>
              (1:58) Next, the O in SWOT stands for
              opportunities. Opportunities are external
              factors that an organization or individual can
              use to their advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:09) These factors often arise from changes
              in the market, technological advancements, or
              shifts in consumer preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:16) Identifying opportunities allows
              organizations to plan strategically and take
              actions that align with current trends or
              potential growth areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:25) For example, a company that notices a
              growing demand for eco-friendly products might
              view this as an opportunity to launch a new
              line of sustainable goods.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:35) By taking advantage of opportunities,
              organizations can expand their market presence
              and stay ahead of competitors.
            </p>
            <h3>Threats</h3>
            <p>
              (2:42) Next, the T in SWOT stands for threats.
              Threats are external factors that could
              potentially harm an organization or hinder
              progress toward goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:49) These may include market competition,
              economic fluctuations, regulatory changes, or
              shifts in consumer behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:56) Identifying threats helps organizations
              prepare for challenges and develop strategies
              to mitigate their impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:05) For instance, a business facing
              increased competition from new market entrants
              might consider this a threat and respond by
              enhancing its marketing strategies or
              improving product offerings.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:17) Understanding potential threats allows
              organizations to be proactive, minimizing
              risks and safeguarding their position in the
              market.
            </p>
