            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              (0:00) Good morning! My name is Kelly Hood and
              I'm a cyber security engineer at Optic Cyber
              Solutions. I've been using the NIST Cyber
              Security Framework for years, both in my
              company and working with clients to help them
              implement it for themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:12) For anyone new to the CSF—and now that
              the 2.0 update has been officially released—I
              wanted to create a quick overview of what the
              cyber security framework is and why you would
              use it.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:21) The NIST CSF was initially released
              back in 2014 and underwent a minor update in
              2018. But just last month, in February 2024,
              NIST released the first major update to the
              framework, resulting in CSF 2.0.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:34) The CSF was initially created to help
              secure U.S. critical infrastructure but was
              quickly adopted by companies across industries
              of all sizes. Due to its flexible nature,
              companies found it really helpful for figuring
              out what to do without having it prescribed to
              them exactly how they needed to implement
              cyber security.
            </p>
            <h3>What is CSF?</h3>
            <p>
              (0:55) The cyber security framework has three
              primary components: <strong>the Core</strong>,
              <strong>the Tiers</strong>, and
              <strong>the Profiles</strong>.
            </p>
            <h3>Core</h3>
            <p>
              (0:59) The Core is a set of cyber security
              outcomes that can be used to understand:
              <em
                >What is it that I need to do in my cyber
                security program?</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:24) One of the great things about the Core
              is that it's written in plain language and
              gives you an idea of what you need to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:29) The Core is written in a hierarchical
              structure, starting out with the
              <strong>Functions</strong> at the top,
              breaking down into
              <strong>Categories</strong>, and then into
              <strong>Subcategories</strong> at the lowest
              level.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:38) This has been one of the key values of
              the CSF over the last decade because it allows
              you to talk to people at the level they are.
              For example, you can have a conversation with
              your board at the
              <strong>Function</strong> level, talking about
              how you're protecting your systems and
              responding to incidents.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:52) Then, when you need to talk to your
              team, you can get into the weeds at the
              <strong>Subcategory</strong> level, talking
              about your backup strategy or the new tool
              you're going to use for anomaly detection.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:01) The Core provides flexibility for
              companies to figure out what works best for
              them and talk about it at the level that makes
              sense—without dictating exactly what you have
              to do.
            </p>
            <h3>Implementation Tiers</h3>
            <p>
              (2:12) This leads to the
              <strong>Implementation Tiers</strong>, which
              answer questions like:
              <em>How should I do this?</em> or
              <em
                >How do I make sure I know if it's
                working?</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:18) The Tiers can be a great tool for
              measuring what we've done and telling others
              about our goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:21) CSF Tiers characterize the rigor of
              your cyber security risk governance and
              management capabilities and are broken down
              into four levels—from
              <strong>Partial</strong> to
              <strong>Adaptive</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Tier 1: Partial</strong> –
                Organizations start here with largely ad hoc
                processes that may not address cyber
                security risk.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tier 2: Risk-Informed</strong> –
                Indicates a concerted effort to prioritize
                capabilities and protect what matters most.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tier 3: Repeatable</strong> –
                Organization-wide approach implemented
                consistently, ensuring everyone meets
                expectations and senior leadership is
                informed.

                preparing for future threats before they
                occur.

              (3:04) Many organizations choose to stop at
              Tier 3. Tier 4 can be expensive but is
              necessary in some cases.

            <h3>Profiles</h3>
            <p>
              (3:29) The third component is
              <strong>Profiles</strong>. A Profile is simply
              a way to capture what you're doing as it
              relates to the CSF Core.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:37) There are many types of Profiles that
              could be created, and you don't have to use
              any of them at all—but they are very helpful.
            </p>
            <p>(3:44) Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Organizational Profiles</strong> –
                Characterize what a specific company is
                doing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Community Profiles</strong> –
                Characterize outcomes or requirements based
                on industries, technologies, or threat
                types.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              (3:57) Within organizational profiles, you can
              have:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Current Profile</strong> – Defines
                what your company is doing today.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Target Profile</strong> – Captures
                what you think you should be doing in the
                future.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              (4:08) Profiles are flexible in form—they can
              be bullet points, paragraphs, or even images
              like Harvey Balls. Do what works for your
              company and helps you understand and capture
              what you need to do in the future.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              (4:24) To wrap things up: CSF 2.0 is a great
              tool whether you're just starting your cyber
              security journey or looking to enhance
              existing practices. Its structured yet
              flexible approach provides a roadmap for
              figuring out what you need to do when it comes
              to cyber security.
            </p>
            <p>
              (4:40) The CSF enables easier conversations at
              every level of an organization—from strategic
              discussions with your board to technical
              conversations with your IT and security teams.
            </p>
            <p>
              (4:52) Remember, the goal is to manage your
              cyber security risks and build resilience
              against evolving threats. Let CSF 2.0 guide
              your efforts to
