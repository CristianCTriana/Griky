        The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a

        organizations in managing information security and

          Each step is designed to ensure that security and
          privacy considerations are integrated throughout
          the system life cycle. Its integration with
          enterprise risk management (ERM) frameworks allows
          cybersecurity to be treated as a
          <span style="color: #05c3de; font-weight: bold"

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              (0:00) Hi there, I'm Mike Chapel and in this
              Cert Mike Explains video I'm going to walk you
              through a topic that's showing up on many
              cybersecurity certification exams: the Risk
              Management Framework published by the National
              Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:15) I'll tell you why the framework exists,
              how you can use it, and then explain the seven
              steps in the NIST risk management process.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:24) Risk management is a complex topic, and
              fortunately, organizations don't need to
              design their own risk management processes
              from the ground up.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:33) Risk management frameworks provide
              proven, time-tested techniques for performing
              enterprise risk management.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:41) One of the most widely used risk
              management frameworks was developed by the
              National Institute of Standards and
              Technology, a U.S. federal government agency.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:50) Their process is mandatory for many
              government computer systems, but private
              organizations have also widely adopted this
              framework because they find it to be a helpful
              approach.
            </p>
            <h3>NIST Special Publication 800-37</h3>
            <p>
              (1:01) The details of the framework are found
              in NIST Special Publication 800-37.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:07) This document runs over 60 pages and
              includes a lot of detail on the framework.
              It's great reading for anyone involved in risk
              management.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:16) That publication is available for free
              on NIST's website.
            </p>
            <h3>Gather Information</h3>
            <p>
              (1:20) Before beginning the risk management
              process, an organization should gather
              information from two different categories.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:27) The first set of information is about
              the technology architecture and includes
              reference models, technical details, business
              process information, and information system
              boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:39) The second input to the process is
              organization-specific information, including
              the laws, regulations, and policies that
              apply; the strategy of the organization; its
              priorities; resource availability; and supply
              chain information.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:55) We can then take all of this
              information gathered during preparation and
              begin the six-step NIST risk management
              process.
            </p>
            <h3>Free Study Plans</h3>
            <p>
              (2:04) Before I explain the six steps of that
              process, I just want to take a moment to
              invite you to visit my website at
              <strong>certmike.com</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:12) On that site, I have free study plans
              put together to help you earn your next
              cybersecurity certification.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2:18) The plans tie together content you'll
              find in study guides, video courses, and
              practice tests to help you prepare for your
              next certification exam and pass that test on
              the first try.
            </p>

            <h3>Risk Management Process</h3>
            <p>
              (2:44) Okay, back to the risk management
              process. After gathering information about the
              technology architecture and the organization
              itself, the process enters
              <strong>Step 1</strong>, where we categorize
              the information system being assessed as well
              as the information that's stored, processed,
              and transmitted by that system.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:02) We normally do this by performing an
              impact assessment.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:06) Then we move on to
              <strong>Step 2</strong>, where the
              organization selects the security controls
              that should be used to manage the risks to the
              information system.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:15) This selection is based upon the
              system's categorization from Step 1. We likely
              begin with a standard baseline of controls and
              then add or subtract specific controls to
              tailor the specification to the system's
              needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:31) After we do that selection, we move on
              to <strong>Step 3</strong>, where we actually
              implement those selected controls.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:38) In <strong>Step 4</strong>, we perform
              a control assessment to determine whether the
              controls were correctly implemented, operate
              correctly, and meet security requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:49) After we finish that assessment, we
              enter <strong>Step 5</strong>, where we
              authorize operation of the information system.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3:56) In the federal government,
              authorization is a very formal process where a
              senior government official must accept any
              remaining risks.

            <p>
              (4:05) Then, once the system is authorized and
              running, we move on to
              <strong>Step 6</strong> of the process, where
              we monitor the security controls on an ongoing
              basis to ensure their continued effectiveness
              and make sure we respond to any environmental
              changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              (4:20) If this monitoring detects significant
              issues, the cycle can begin again.

              (4:24) This risk management framework helps
              provide structure for the way an organization
              approaches making decisions about risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              (4:32) In practice, you'll want to adapt these
              steps to meet the needs of your own
              organization.
