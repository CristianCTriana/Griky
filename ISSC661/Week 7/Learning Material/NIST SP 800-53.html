        The NIST Special Publication 800-53 is a
        comprehensive catalog of security and privacy
        controls used primarily by federal agencies and
        contractors. It supports the RMF by providing
        detailed guidance on selecting and implementing
        controls based on system impact levels.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>(0:00) [Music]</p>
            <p>
              (0:10) Hello everyone and welcome to the NIST
              SP 800-53 course. My name is Arun P and I'm
              the instructor for the course.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:20) Let's take a look at the synopsis. This
              course contains three sections.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:30) In summary, it will introduce you to
              the NIST SP 800-53 framework, the key control
              family deep dive, and exploring the risk
              management assessment capability of the NIST
              SP 800-53 framework.
            </p>
            <p>
              (0:49) There are three sections, each
              consisting of an hour session. Section one
              introduces you to NIST SP 800-53. Section two
              talks about the key control families, and
              section three will take you through the risk
              assessment and management processes and
              capabilities, along with the necessary tooling
              required to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
              (1:18) While the first three sections of this
              course are mainly focused on foundational
              elements, there are additional sections in the
              course which will talk more about practical
